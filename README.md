## Description
I was told many times in the leadup to this week that Javascript was the hardest part of the bootcamp, and that the intro section was particularly hard. I found it to be a challenging beginning to my relationship with Javascript, but, versatility and usefulness are apparent. The challenge was a great way to familiarize myself with intro concepts, and it felt extremely rewarding to work through. 

At the beginning of the project, I did not feel comfortable with the concepts presented (variables, math functions, ect.) I have a much firmer grasp of those concepts now, in thanks to the research necessary. 

The major takeaway I had from this project, however, was the importance of psuedo-coding, and it's impact on working though problems. The impact it had on my direction and comfort with the project was instantaneous.
